## What is it?
basically it is collection of scripts that shows current COVID-19 data and RSS feed and sends it to email

This script is doing:
- [showing current cases and share of positive test](covid_stats.ipynb)
- [checks rss feeds if any new posts](get_feed.py)
- [sends it to email](send_email.py)

## I want to use it on my own 
sure, I'm glad you like it üòÑ. All you need to do is add few github secrets ([see yaml](.github/workflows/main.yml)), change your country in [notebook](covid_stats.ipynb) and your email provider in [send_email](send_email.py) 

### bruh why yahoo?
I have choseen yahoo because you can make account there easly and forget about it until yahoo will eventually shut down lol

Feel free to use however it suits you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
